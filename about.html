        </h3>
        <br>Vaibhavi Agrawal is an IITian, persuing her B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay. One of the founder member of the great "The Game Changers", she was born on 6th June, 2001 in Raipur, Chattisgarh. She takes immense pride in calling herself tall (height 165cm), altough people of her height would come in handy as an armrest. A fun-loving, mischievous girl at heart, who loves dancing, gardening, exploring new things, reading, going for trips. Although, her enthusiasm has no bounds: always in for the outings and birthday celebrations, leaves no stone unturned to convince the thakelu GC guyzz for making hangout plans. When bored, she loves spamming the gc group with her super funny repertoire of stickers. Part of the revered NSS Green Campus division, during her freshie year, she has shown keen interest in acknowledging the plants and trees around the campus. With the potential she has, she truly would be a great asset to the society. Remember to keep up the name of "The Game Changers" gang :D.

      </h3>
      <br>Let's rewind our clocks a bit; it is September 2018, some freshers saw the mixed cricket tournament posters, and they are eager to participate. The only problem: it was a MIXED tournament so your team must comprise of 3 girls at least.
      That's where Harsh came into the picture; the self-proclaimed "playboi" of the group. He assured he knew folks who will be willing to play.
      While playing cricket one evening, Durgesh introduced us to some fellow batchmates, Vaibhavi, Anjana and Harshita, who would join the team for the match and soon were an integral part of the gang.

      <p>The name of the group has an interesting story of its own. After intense brainstorming sessions, the only names we could come up with were Bombay Bhadwes and Mumbai Mambas, before eventually settling on The Game Changers unequivocally.

      <p>The fateful evening of the match came, and while we lost the first match and got eliminated from the tournament on the first day itself, we won something far more important. Now, Game changers is not just a bunch of friends hanging out
        together; it is something more than that. Something which comprises purely of emotion and can't be expressed in mere words.

      <p>Cut back to the present; The GC family consists of 15 members, with Pavan being the latest addition to the team. Been on many Adventures together and hopefully many more to come.

      <p>Cheers to all the fun night outs we have had together and for the ones that are yet to come.
